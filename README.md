OpenStud is an **unofficial** Open Source client by [Leonardo Sarra](https://github.com/leosarra/) for Sapienza's Infostud platform. This fork, initiated by [Matteo Collica](https://github.com/matypist/), adapted it to the latest changes in the examination booking system, in the login endpoint and aims to continue its development.

_It was developed with Java 8, targets Android 13 (API Level 33), and supports devices running Android 6.0 (API Level 23) and above._
